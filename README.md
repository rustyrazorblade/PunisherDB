This is a demo versioned key value database implementing RAMP transactions as outlined in http://www.bailis.org/papers/ramp-sigmod2014.pdf.  In particular, I've implemented the algorithm RAMP-Fast, which I've also documented here: http://rustyrazorblade.com/2015/11/ramp-made-easy/

This DB is not recommended for production.
